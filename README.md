## How to install the game

* Clone the repository
* Go to "Racing Game" folder
* Click "DriveToPass" app

## How to play

User only needs to use left and right arrow keys to control the car and avoid the cars that get in the way. Taking gems increases the car's speed and the goal of the game is to stay on the road as long as you can without hitting any car.
